Homework 4

1. Formulate a recursive definition whether it is true that a string contains a specified character.

2. Formulate a recursive definition of x raised to the power of y for non-negative y. Hints: for the base case, specify what the result is when y is 0, for the recursive case define the result as x multiplied by the result for a smaller y.

3. Formulate a recursive definition for the sum of squares of the numbers in an array.


Format your definitions to show what the result IS rather than what you do first and what next, clearly identify the base and recursive cases.

4. Implement one of the recursive definitions above (your choice) as a recursive Java method. Communicate through parameters and return values (do not use data fields). Please submit code and show result.
